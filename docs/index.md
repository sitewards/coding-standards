# Sitewards Coding Standard

## What is this?

These are the Sitewards Coding Standards. They're here on GitHub to make them easy to find, and that developers from
both the open source community and our internal development team can have a canonical reference.

## Where do I find the standards?

Where defined, standards are available in the nav menu.
